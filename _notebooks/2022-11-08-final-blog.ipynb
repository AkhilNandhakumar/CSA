    "- Question 4:\n",
    "    - I answered 2.33333333 instead of 2, because I didn't check to see what type of variable the num was. Because the variable type was Int, the result would be truncated to 2, not a double.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 15\n",
    "    - I thought solution II worked, and it technically did, but I did not iterate the whole way through and assumed that the for loop had the correct length, but it throws and outOfBounds error because it iterates too many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 23\n",
    "    - My answer would have worked if the condition for the loop was k > 1, not k > 0. I need to just read more carefully so that when I would out the iteration steps, I get the correct outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 36\n",
    "    - I missclicked, this question was really easy, I thought I chose the correct answer but I guess I didn't,\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "Overall, I did really well. a 36/40 on the MCQ section and a good performance on the FRQ section would be a 5 on the ap exam. The part I really need to work on is maybe slowing down a bit and making sure I read the code given more closely to avoid making silly mistakes. All of the mistakes I made were not conceptual which is good, but to get a perfect score I need ot pay more attention on the instruction on the questions. "
