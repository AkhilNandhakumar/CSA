    "As a someone looking forward to working in a STEM job, the information I learned from the speakers will be is extremely useful and applicable to me. Both Mr. Porter and Ms. Berveridge spoke on the agile methodology which is something that we have been learning about in class through implementation. They explained that being familiar with agile is highly regarded in the high-tech workforce, and hearing that from them highlighted the importance of using it in CSA class. They explained that the collaboration and teamwork skills we have been using were very effective in their jobs, helping them coordinate projects of all sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to that specific skills, Mr. Porter explained that benefits of being knowledgeable in computer science for use in any field or area. For me personally, learning how to code can be a valuable skill in a career in mechanical engineering or aerospace engineering. It is a way of thinking critically and applying those skills to real-world problems. Even though it may not be specifically computer science related, mechanical and aerospace engineering incorporate a large amount of programming, like developing algorithms and simulations to improve the design and performance of specific parts or computers. This illustrates how learning computer science now would definitely help me pursue a career in this field."
