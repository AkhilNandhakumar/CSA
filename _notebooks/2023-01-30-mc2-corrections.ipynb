    "I understand all of the concepts for each question, and feel good about taking the MC portion of the AP exam. I only missed 2 questions due to silly mistakes or just going too fast. Similar to the first mc we did, I did much better on 2D array questions. I want to work on working faster and more accurately since I split this up into a few sessions. Within the given time limit on the AP Exam, I should be able to finish on time, but it is a bit close, which is why I want to work on being a bit more efficient when answering the problems."
