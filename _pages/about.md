# About Akhil Nandhakumar
!["Me and my brother Nakul!"](https://github.com/AkhilNandhakumar/CSA/blob/master/images/me_1.jpeg?raw=true)

I am a senior at Del Norte High School, and am taking AP CSA this year. My goals for this class is to fully understand Object Oriented Programing, and become proficient programming in Java.

Outside of this class, my academic goals are to major in Aerospace Engineering and hopefully do computational mechanics for either the automotive industry or aviation.

I love playing tennis with my brother Nakul, practicing piano, singing, and learning fun things on my own in my free time, like how to backflip and juggling. I like being outdoors and spending time with my family, and am excited for my future in college and in a career.
