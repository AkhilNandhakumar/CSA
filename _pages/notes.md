***

## Unit 1: Primitive Types [Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)
> Learn the fundamentals of Java, a programming language, as well as other foundational concepts for coding.

## Unit 2: Using Objects [Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)
> Explore reference data as a way to represent real-world objects in a digital world and discover methods to perform more complex operations.

## Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements [Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)
> Delve into the building blocks of algorithms and focus on using conditional statements to solve problems and control results.

## Unit 4: Iteration [Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)
> Learn about iteration, another building block of algorithms that are for repetition.

## Unit 5: Writing Classes [Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)
> Explore how real-world interactions can be expressed digitally by organizing behaviors and attributes into classes, and youâ€™ll examine the legal and ethical implications of computer programming.

## Unit 6: Array [Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)
> Learn techniques and standard algorithms to work with collections of related data, known as data structures.

## Unit 7: ArrayList [Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)
> Delve deeper into data sets, exploring ArrayList objects for larger amounts of data, as well as the privacy concerns related to personal data storage.

## Unit 8: 2D Array [Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)
> Branch out into 2D arrays and experiment with data sets represented in a table.

## Unit 9: Inheritance [Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)
> Learn how to manipulate programming without altering existing code by using subclasses to create a hierarchy.

## Unit 10: Recursion [Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)
> Work on solving larger problems by solving smaller, simpler versions of the same problem using recursive methods.
